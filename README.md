## Structure / Guidelines

- Indent with soft tabs (two spaces.)
- Frontend files are in the `app/assets` directory.
- Within those directories, organize files however you like.
- You can use es6 and `import` / `export` in js files.
- Add third-party dependencies to the Gemfile and `application.js`. They will generally be included in the global JS scope.
- You can use `@import` in scss files.
- HTML files are stored in `app/views`.
- They use erb, see: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html
- Don't hardcode asset URLs anywhere. Instead use asset helpers, like this:
    - HTML: `<%= image_tag 'image.png', alt: "image" %>` or `<img src="<%= image_path('image.png') %>" alt="image">`
    - SCSS: `background-image: image-url('image.png');`
